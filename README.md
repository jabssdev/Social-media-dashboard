## Overview

This project focuses on developing an interactive user interface that presents a social media dashboard. The goal is to create a modern, functional and fully responsive web application that offers a fluid user experience on a variety of devices, from smartphones to desktop computers.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle color theme to their preference

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

In this project I learned how to:

- Manage the 'dark:' class of tailwind
- Control and divide react components in a better way.
- Create custom hooks and utilities, in order to reuse them and not repeat code.

### Continued development

In the near future I would like to learn how to use the react framework, called next.js, as well as create a crud with some backend language like laravel or django, and be able to consume the data from the interface.
